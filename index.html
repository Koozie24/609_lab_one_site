            <p>My name is Jake and I am a 25 year-old Computer Science graduate student and full time Network Administrator.
                A little bit about me: My fiance, Dzejna, and I have a Rhodesian Ridgeback named Bentley. We live in Berne, IN. Upon Graduation my goal is to become a professional programmer.
                So far, I have programmed a few text based games in both C and Python that can be played on the command line. At work, I have developed several Python programs which automate
                Active Directory user creation, Microsoft 365 user creation, and notification to various departments and managers via email.
